# Alo!

## Welcome to my website.

🧕🏾 My name is Shiba and i am learning code as a hobby.

💻 I am interested mostly in python and javascript.

## Learning to code.

1. To be honest, its taking abit more time than i originally planned, but hey i am getting there.

2. Currently mastering the command for git and github and proud of it.

3. While i would have loved to be BEE, FEE looked easier to grasp, allows creativity too. Cant wait to be at my fullest potential.
